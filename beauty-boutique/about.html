        BOUNTIFUL BOUTIQUE has seen some remarkable accomplishments over the past 30 years.With a goal to become an $8 billion company
        by 2017 and open 600 stores in the next three years, it’ll be exciting to see the company achieve in three years what it initially
        took 30 years to do.</p>
        <p>BOUNTIFUL BOUTIQUE is the 5th largest specialty retailer in the United States. A customer from Toronto named her daughter Tiev
        Forever Golding because she almost had her baby in a Forever 21 store. Once the child’s passport expires, they plan to legally
        change her first name to “FOREVER”.
        <br><br>The average BOUNTIFUL BOUTIQUE store is 38,000 square feet, the largest is approximately 162,000 square feet and the
        original BB21 store is only 900 square feet.
        <br><abbr title="Bountiful Boutique 21">BB21</abbr> rung up $700,000 in sales in its first year. The prior three businesses that occupied that building failed within the
        first year. Even with the company’s tremendous growth, it still remains a family owned business.</p>
